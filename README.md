# MedicalChatApp
Hi, this is a full stack medical chat app that i designed using javaScript,React, nodeJs, twilio(messaging app), stream(server side), with the help of programming languages java and modern api integration techniques. I used visual studio code for all my debugging. The app won't be operational  since it is not posted to the internet because of expenses and is  currently only linked with my accound and requires a user accound in stream(free accound only valid for 28 days) for starting. The accound in stream and twilio gives the user his/her own unique appID, apiKey and other identifications.The app works in the react version 16 and 17, but may encounder issues while in react18, since features like reactDom.render and other properties has been changed with root functions and may cause compactability issues. "The main purpose of this project is to showcase my skills as a full stack devloper to my future-employers. Hence, let my work as a full stack developer having skills at front end and back end speak for me". please do check this out and commets will also be appreciated.
